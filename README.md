Here is my portfolio website. A very simple react app to showcase my ability to fully integrate a frontend design. Please feel free to play around with it!

# Features

2. The buttons are also responsive when its hovered over
3. Icons such as Linkedin and Github directs you to my websites
4. When Resume button is clicked, it will download an update PDF of my resume
5. Utilize flex box for the front end and help with responsiveness

7. Skills are also added, which are things I am very good at and comfortable using
8. Contact section was the fun one to create. Feel free to send me a message and will get them to my personal email
